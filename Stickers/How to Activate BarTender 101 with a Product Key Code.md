If you have purchased a license for BarTender 10.1, you will need to activate it with a product key code. A product key code is a 25-digit alphanumeric code that you receive when you buy BarTender 10.1 from an authorized reseller or online store. You can also get a free 30-day trial of BarTender 10.1 from the official website.
 
In this article, we will show you how to activate BarTender 10.1 with a product key code in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Install BarTender 10.1
 
Before you can activate BarTender 10.1, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the software from the [downloads page](https://www.seagullscientific.com/support/downloads/) and then follow the [installation guide](https://support.seagullscientific.com/hc/en-us/articles/204770058-Installing-BarTender) to install BarTender 10.1.
 
## Step 2: Launch the Activation Wizard
 
After you install BarTender 10.1, you will see an activation wizard pop up on your screen. You can also launch the activation wizard manually by clicking on the BarTender icon on your desktop and then selecting Help > Activate.
 
The activation wizard will ask you to choose between activating your software or using it as a trial. Choose to activate your software and click Next.
 
## Step 3: Enter your Product Key Code
 
On the next screen, you will need to enter your product key code into the boxes. You can find your product key code on the confirmation email that you received when you purchased BarTender 10.1 or on the product packaging if you bought a physical copy.
 
Make sure that you enter the product key code correctly and without any spaces or dashes. Click Next when you are done.
 
## Step 4: Specify where to host your license
 
On the next screen, you will need to specify where you want to host your license. You can choose to host your license on the current computer or on another computer on your network.
 
If you want to host your license on the current computer, simply choose your computer from the list. If you want to host it on another computer, you can choose the name from the list (if it's broadcasting) or type in the host's name or IP address and port number.
 
Hosting your license on another computer allows you to share it with other users who have BarTender 10.1 installed on their computers. However, you will need to have an Automation or Enterprise edition of BarTender 10.1 to do this.
 
Click Next when you have made your choice.
 
## Step 5: Complete the activation process
